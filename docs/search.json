Our group works to create new perspectives on how humans and wildlife can coexist in an era of rapid change. More about our group’s research activity can be found on our website.\nThis lab manual is intended to provide an overview about how we do our work and expectations for our team. It is also a space to document institutional knowledge and available resources. If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please submit a GitHub Issue.\nOur lab manual is adapted from and inspired by the Fay Lab and Huckley Lab’s own manuals as well as the Bren Graduate Student Handbook.",
